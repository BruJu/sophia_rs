//! A `TripleSource` produces triples, and may also fail in the process.
//! 
//! If provies an API similar to (a subset of) the `Iterator` API,
//! with methods such as [`for_each_triple`] and [`try_for_each_triple`].
//! 
//! # Rationale (or Why not simply use `Iterator`?)
//!
//! The [`Iterator`] trait is designed in such a way that items must live at least as long as the iterator itself.
//! This assumption may be too strong in some situations.
//!
//! For example,
//! consider a parser using 3 buffers to store the subject, predicate,
//! and object of the triples it parses.
//! Each time it extracts a triple from the data,
//! it yields it (as 3 references to its internal buffers)
//! to the closure passed to `for_each_triple`.
//! Then, it **reuses** the buffers to store the data for the next triple,
//! and yields the new triple, as 3 references to the *same* buffers.
//!
//! Such a parser can not implement [`Iterator`],
//! because, once yielded by the iterator's `next` method,
//! an item is free to live during further iterations.
//! In particular, it can be stored in a vector,
//! and still be alive when the `next` method is called again
//! (consider for example the [`Iterator::collect`] method).
//!
//! Because many parsers (as well as other triple sources)
//! will be implemented in a manner similar to that described above,
//! we have to provide a trait with *weaker assumptions*
//! on the lifetime of the yielded triples.
//!
//! The alternative would be to wrap such parsers with a layer that would *copy*
//! the data from internal buffers to fresh buffers for each triples,
//! but we do not want to impose that cost on all implementations
//! â€” especially when many consumers will be happy with short-lived references.
