//! An RDF triple expresses a single fact.
//! Its formed of three terms called *subject*, *predicate* and *object*.
//! 
//! You can think of a triple as a sentence of the form
//! "subject verb complement"
//! (although the *predicate* is often better expressed as a relationship than a verb).
//! ExamplesÂ :
//! 
//! * John is a person.
//! * John was born in Paris.
//! * John knows Jane.
//! * John's family name is "Doe".
//!
